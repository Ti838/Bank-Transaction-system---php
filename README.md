## Database Partitioning

The system utilizes a simplified, high-performance data model:

1. **users** - Unified entity containing Authentication & Profile Data (Full Name, Address, Bio, etc.).
2. **roles** - Role definitions (Admin, Staff, Customer).
3. **accounts** - Financial vaults linked to Users.
4. **transactions** - Immutable operational ledger.
5. **notifications** - User alerts and messaging.
6. **settings** - Global system configuration parameters.

## Security Architecture

- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Strict permission isolation.
- **Data Integrity**: Foreign key constraints with cascading logic.
- **Input Sanitization**: Prepared statements using PDO.
- **Session Security**: Multi-point validation and attempt limiting.
